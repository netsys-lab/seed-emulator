    @brief this class provides connectivity for emulated nodes 
    from within an emulated network to the external 'real' Internet
    via the hosts network.
    It mediates between hosts who might a service installed that requires realWorldConnectivity (i.e. DevService (git,go,cargo etc.))
    the network and a RealWorldRouter who actually provides the ExternalReachability.
    This is the exact opposite of what the RemoteAccessProvider does.

    It achieves this, by making the host's default gateway router into a RealWorldRouter.
    The user need not bother with minding this himself(can keep using AS::createRouter() 
    and any extra functionality will be 'mixed'in on demand later automatically).
